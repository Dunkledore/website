					<p>My journey after leaving secondary school was slightly abnormal. All of my dreams had revolved around going to a top university, getting a top degree and embarking on a career- motivated by the idea of wealth. However, after starting university, I discovered that, at that time, it was not the place for me. The course I picked had elements that I struggled with, and the general lifestyle was not regimented enough for me. This led to me dropping out. After a short while, with intentions of returning to university, I started working part-time in a brasserie. Entering the working world was a real eye opener for me and gave me lots of new perspectives. I then moved into working with the computers at the same place, where I stayed for a total of 2 years. Despite having a good job, good friends and a stable lifestyle, I wasn't satisfied. I did my research and decided I needed to go to Malawiâ€¦</p>	

					<h2><span class="black"></span><span class="green"> Application</span> process</h2>
					<p>This for me was a very quick process. I applied through Lattitude's website and within a few days I had an interview. I met with a lady called Nicola and we had a 1 hour long chat about Malawi, so that both parties could establish whether it was a suitable endeavour for me. After our interview I was told that Lattitude would be in touch shortly. I then had a short interview with the Malawi Country Manager, Matt Maroon and after that. I was in!!</p>

					<h2><span class="black">The</span><span class="green"> paperwork</span></h2>
					<p>As one can image, there is a lot of paperwork involved with a trip like this:</p>
					<ul class="ul">
						<li>Visa - Sending off the Visa is a fairly complicated process of postal orders, return postage and a whole plethora of forms and bank statemnts and... I messed it up. I forgot to send in the return envelop which led to me having to go all the way into London to pick it up by hand. But, In the end, Visa sorted</li>
						<li>Flights - This one was easy. Nicola asked STA Travel for a quote. It seemed like the best one so I got it. Job done</li>
						<li>Police Checks - This is a simple DBS form which I had done for other companies before.</li>
						<li>Insurance - Since I was planning on taking some expensive equipment with me, looking for insurance was slightly more challenging. Contents cover for Malawi comes few and far between however, with the help of Dad :), we managed to find appropriate insurance</li>
						<li>Medical Clearance - This is a simple letter that needs to be signed by a medical professional just to make sure you are fit an healthy to travel to Malawi</li>
						<li>Fees - Lattitude has bills to pay...</li>
					</ul>

					<h2><span class="black"></span><span class="green">Injections</span> and tablets</h2>
					<p>If you are squeamish, skip this bit. I knew Malawi has certain dieseases that require precautions, however I didn't quite expect as many as this. Here is the full list of my injectiojns:</p>
					<ul class="ul">
						<li>Tetanus, Polio, Dipheria - This comes as one</li>
						<li>Hepatitus A and B - 3 Injections</li>
						<li>Typhoid</li>
						<li>Cholera</li>
						<li>Rabies - This comes as 3</li>
						<li>Yellow Fever</li>
					</ul>

					<h2><span class="black">Pre-Departure</span><span class="green"> Breifing</span></h2>
					<p>It is a mandatory requirement that you have a briefing before travelling on a Lattitude trip, and rightfully so. My briefing was held in Reading, which is around 30 minutes from where I live. My mother came with me for this, as we hoped it would ease her worrying about the trip. This is where I met Martha and Odette, who are also travelling to Malawi from the UK. The brief was very informative and did a good job of painting a realistic picture of life in Malawi</p>

					<h2><span class="black">Packing</span></h2>
					<p>Much to the discomfort of my mother, I am not an organised person. So packing was left rather late. That being said, after a quick trip into town for last minute essentials, everything was ready to go. Oh - I packed way too much though.</p>
